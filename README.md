This is a management game of sorts. You are the manager of a new SCP reaserch and containment facolity for anomolous entities. This will involve having to find and capture anomolous entities and bring them back to the facility you are constructing. You only have a limited amount of funding, increased by taking care of more and more entities. Keeping these enteties in good condition will result in bonuses to the funding of the facility & reaserch.
